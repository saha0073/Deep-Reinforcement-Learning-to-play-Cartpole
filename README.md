## Deep Reinforcement Learning 

Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) is a subfield of machine learning that combines reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning. 
RL considers the problem of a computational agent learning to make decisions by trial and error. 
Deep RL incorporates deep learning into the solution by implementing a Deep Q-Network (DQN), allowing agents to make decisions from unstructured input data without 
manual engineering of the state space. DQNs are able to take in very large inputs 
(e.g. every pixel rendered to the screen in a video game) and decide what actions to perform to optimize an objective 
(eg. maximizing the game score). Deep reinforcement learning has been used for a diverse set of applications including 
but not limited to robotics, video games, natural language processing, computer vision, education, transportation, finance and healthcare.

## The steps

* Create OpenAI gym environments for playing CartPole
* Build a DQN Model for Reinforcement Learning using Tensorflow and Keras
* Train the DQN model using Deep Q policy based learning with Keras-RL
* Play CartPole with the trained DQN
